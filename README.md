## Introduction:
---
    
Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

    
## Goal:
---
    
Determine how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Identify trends in the historical bike trip data.
